Subject: arm64: dts: allwinner: Drop non-removable from SoPine/LTS SD card

[ Upstream commit 941432d007689f3774646e41a1439228b6c6ee0e ]

The SD card on the SoPine SoM module is somewhat concealed, so was
originally defined as "non-removable".
However there is a working card-detect pin (tested on two different
SoM versions), and in certain SoM base boards it might be actually
accessible at runtime.
Also the Pine64-LTS shares the SoPine base .dtsi, so inherited the
non-removable flag, even though the SD card slot is perfectly accessible
and usable there. (It turns out that just *my* board has a broken card
detect switch, so I originally thought CD wouldn't work on the LTS.)

Drop the "non-removable" flag to describe the SD card slot properly.
